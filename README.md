# Building a weather app!!

Here's an exciting challenge: You'll be building a small weather app, using your newfound skills with APIs!

## Setting up

#### ðŸš€ Make sure you follow all of these steps!

For this homework you'll be using your newfound knowledge of the Open Weather API!!! In case you didn't get your API key set up in class today, please follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a free [Open Weather Map](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) account!
2. Once you've signed up, you're given an [API key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys). Copy that API key and keep track of it somewhere!
3. Open Postman to check out the data you're working with & to verify that your key works. Make a GET requrest to the following URL in postman, adding your API key to the end.

```
http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=10025,us?units=imperial&appid=[PUT YOUR API KEY HERE]
```

#### You'll be working in the [weather directory](./weather/), in `index.html`, `src/main.js`, and `style/style.css`.

## In the end, your weather app will look like this in the mobile view:

## Your page should have:
- An input field for a user to enter a zip code
- A submit button
- When the submit button is clicked:
    - A GET request should fetch the weather data from the API
    - The following data should be rendered on the page:
        - City name
        - Current temperature
        - Weather description
        - Min temp
        - Max temp
- Have the temperature turn blue if under 40, and red if above 90.

Here are some zip codes to test!
- 99501 (Anchorage)
- 99723 (Barrow, AK)
- 60605 (Chicago)
- 70124 (New Orleans)
- 77030 (Houston, TX)
- 00902 (San Juan, Puerto Rico)
- 46923 (Delphi, IN)
- 94123 (San Francisco, CA)
